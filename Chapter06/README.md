# 6. Heapsort

In Chapter 06, another sorting algorithm called Heapsort is introduced. Heapsort's running time is  O(n lg n). Like insertion sort, but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place. Heap is a data structure which is array + rules(the order in which the data is placed).  
The heap data structure is logically a complete binary tree, but physically(actually) an array. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array that stroes the value in the node. An array A that represents a heap. Array A[1  .....  length[A]] consists of length[A] elements. The number of elements in the heap stored whithin array A is heap-size[A] where heap-size[A] <= length[A].

> Using Figure 6.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 3) on the array A = 27, 17, 3, 16, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12, 4, 8, 9, 0.
