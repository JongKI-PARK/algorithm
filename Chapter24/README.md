# 24. Single Source Shortest Paths  

Path is a sequence of edges $(V_i, V_j) \in E$. The weight of the path is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. From the single source , single source shortest problem is to find the minimum weighted path.  



Both Bellman ford algorithm and Dijksta algorithm runtimes are neither a function of weight. They both doesn't depend on the dynamic range of the weight. This is why the BFS and DFS are not directly applicable to the shortest path problem. 
To start with a conclusion, Bellman ford algorithm and Dijksta algorithm takes O(VE) and O(V log V E) respectively.
