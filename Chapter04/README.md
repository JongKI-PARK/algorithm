The substitution method for solving recurrences entails two steps. First guess the form of the solution, and then use the mathematical inductino to find the constants and slow that the solution works. The substitution method can be used to establish either upper or lower bound or lower bound on a recurrences.  
There is no general way to guess the correct solutions to recurrences. Guessing a solution takes experience or use recursion tree to guess intuitively.  

It is difficult to apply the inductive hypothesis only within specific boundaries. Therefore, we will take advantage of asymptotic notation. According to asymptotic notation, we can choose n where n > n0. Therefore, there is no need to apply the inductive assumption for n less than n0.
