## Exercises & Problems

### Bubble sort
> Show the fun time of each line as shown in the insertion sort, then give the worst/best time of bubble sort

### 2. 1-2
> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order. 

### 2. 2-2
> Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ-notation

### 2. 2-3
> Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers

### 2. 3-4
> Insertion sort can be expressed as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort A[1 ... n], we recursively sort A[1 ... n -1] and then insert A[n] into the sorted array A[1 ... n - 1]. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.
