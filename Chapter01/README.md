# 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing  

To solve a problem Data Structure and efficient algorithm is needed. Data Structure is the way data is expressed in memory.

                      -------------------
                     |                   |                     
         input  ->   |     procedure     |  ->   output          
                     |                   |                     
                      -------------------

Algorithm is well defined computational procedure that takes input and output. "Well defined procedure" is important because well defined means that it is expressed logically. Accoring to Turing's idea, If it is expressed logically, it can be done automatically. In other words, if you want something to be done automatically, it should be well defined.
