## About this Repository
This repository is based on "Introduction to Algorithms 2nd edition"  
Summary of each chapters, Exercises and Problems in this book are mainly included in this repository. Plus, Algorithms implemented with C language will be included too!!  

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Junmo Kim for providing me with a good algorithm lecture.  

## Contents
Exercises and Problems in each Chapters and Codes according to each chapters are included and are all grouped by chapters. Not all exercises and problems are covered. I will cover only some of them. However, along with detailed explanations, I have written all of the background knowledge I have studied.
