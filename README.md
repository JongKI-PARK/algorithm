## About this Repository
This repository is based on "Introduction to Algorithms 2nd edition"  
Exercises, Problems in this book are mainly included in this repository. Plus, Algorithms implemented with C language will be included too!!  
Not all exercises and problems are covered. I will cover only some of them. However, along with detailed explanations, I have written all of the background knowledge I have studied.  

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Junmo Kim for providing me with a good algorithm lecture.
